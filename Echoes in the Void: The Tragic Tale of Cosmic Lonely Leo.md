In this darker, non-optimistic version of the story, Cosmic Lonely Leo's journey takes a tragic turn, ending not only with his demise but also contributing to the cataclysmic end of the universe in a Big Rip. Betrayal, deception, and loneliness weave the final chapters of Leo's tale.

Leo's Descent into Despair

Cosmic Lonely Leo, once a majestic guardian of the cosmos, is transformed into human form, imbued with the hope of finding a celestial balance. However, his time in human form is cursed with a fatal limitation – he does not have much time.

The Betrayal of Scorpio

In his human guise, Leo encounters Scorpio, a character embodying the enigmatic and intense traits of the zodiac sign. Unbeknownst to Leo, Scorpio is under the deceptive influence of a malevolent entity, referred to as 'Satan,' who manipulates Scorpio into betraying Leo.

In a moment of calculated treachery, Scorpio stabs Leo, leaving him mortally wounded. This act of betrayal is not just a physical wound; it pierces Leo's soul, deepening his despair and sense of isolation.

The Acceleration of the Big Rip

Leo's despair acts as a catalyst in the already expanding universe. The cosmic balance is further disrupted, accelerating the universe's expansion at an uncontrollable rate. This hastens the onset of the Big Rip – a cataclysmic event where the fabric of the universe itself is torn apart.

The End of Cosmic Lonely Leo

In his final moments, Leo succumbs to his loneliness and wounds. His human form disintegrates, and with it, the last vestiges of hope for finding balance and companionship in the cosmos. Leo's demise is not just the end of a celestial wanderer but also a symbol of the end of an era in the universe.

The Universe's Final Moments

As the Big Rip tears through the cosmos, galaxies, stars, and planets are ripped apart. The universe, once a vibrant tapestry of life and energy, is stretched into oblivion. In these last moments, the universe is a cold, dark, and lonely place – a reflection of the despair that consumed Leo.
